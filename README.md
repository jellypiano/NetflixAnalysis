# Netflix Analysis Project
### Project Overview
This project analyzes a Netflix dataset to discover insights related to content types, genres, release years, user ratings, and more. By performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), the goal is to uncover patterns and trends that can guide strategic decisions for content acquisition and recommendations.

### Features
Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Handle missing values, remove duplicates, and standardize data formats.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Examine distribution of movie genres, release years, and region-based availability.
Visualizations: Generate charts and graphs (bar plots, histograms, heatmaps) to illustrate data insights clearly.
Recommendation Prototype (Optional): Implement a simple content recommendation approach based on selected attributes (genre, cast, director, etc.).
### Technologies & Tools
Python 3
Pandas, NumPy for data manipulation
Matplotlib, Seaborn, or Plotly for visualizations
Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab for interactive exploration
### Dataset
The dataset can be obtained from various sources, such as Kaggle (e.g., “Netflix Movies and TV Shows” dataset).
Ensure the file (netflix_titles.csv or equivalent) is placed in the project’s data folder.
